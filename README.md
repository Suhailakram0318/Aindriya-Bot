# Chatbot API with Document Intelligence and LLM Integration

This project implements a document intelligence API using **FastAPI** and integrates **Google Gemini Flash** LLM (Large Language Model) for answering questions based on indexed documents. Users can upload various documents, text, or URLs, which are processed and stored. The API allows users to ask questions, and it uses the indexed data and conversation history to generate meaningful responses.

## Project Overview

The main purpose of this project is to build an API where users can upload different types of content (documents, plain text, URLs) and then use an advanced LLM model (Google Gemini Flash) to process and answer questions based on the content.

The core functionalities include:
- Uploading documents or text.
- Scraping content from provided URLs.
- Storing and indexing the uploaded data for quick retrieval.
- Asking questions, with responses generated by a language model.
- Storing chat history for context.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Users can upload documents, plain text, and URLs.
- **Document Indexing**: The uploaded documents are indexed using **FAISS** (Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search) for efficient searching.
- **Question Answering**: Users can ask questions, and the chatbot will use the indexed data to provide answers using the **Gemini Flash** LLM.
- **Conversation History**: User queries and assistant responses are stored and used to maintain context during the conversation.
- **Document Scraping**: Users can also provide URLs, and the system will scrape the content of the webpage for indexing.
